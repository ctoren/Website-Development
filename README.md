# Website-Development
Code for Web Development

For a school project, I created a website on a course's webserver. The site was a job board for careers in entertainment. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and CGI. 

HTML was used to create all of the main pages on the site. CSS was used to create the preferred, alternative, and persist stylesheets. Javascript was used to create a neon title on the About page and a rollover effect on images on the same page. On the Home (index) page, Javascript was used to create a date and time effect. On the contact page, Javascript was also used to validate a user's first name when entering information onto the webform. Finally, Javascript was used to create cookies on the Feedback page. PHP was used to save a user's contact information and display it on a new document. CGI was used to calculate how long (months, weeks, days, hours, minutes) a user has been job-hunting.
